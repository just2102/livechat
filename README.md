# livechat
## This is a simple Chat Application that was created with React. It uses Firestore to store and retrieve messages via async requests to the database.
### I learned to configure a Firestore database, use Firebase authentication feature and deploy to Firebase hosting.
#### Live Preview of this project is available at: https://livechat-d1046.web.app/
